    description: `Netflix's F1 show Drive to Survive is back for a second season, and this time even Ferrari
    and Mercedes are on-board. The series gets the behind the scenes drama from last year's championship,
    including Daniel Ricciardo's switch from Red Bull to Renault, his troubled replacement(s) and Charles
    Leclerc's first season for Ferrari. As ever, the preparation and politics of the sport proves even more
    interesting than what happens on the racetrack, with Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Haas'
    Guenther Steiner reprising their star roles. A must-watch for fans warming up for the 2020 season, or F1
    newbies looking to get a glimpse of what it's all about.`

    description: `Take some single girls and single boys, stick a wall between them and make them talk to
     each other. What do you get? Pure chaos. These hopeful romantics are ready to couple up without ever
     seeing each other, and even though several of them say ‘I love you’ after three days, unsurprisingly
     many of the relationships don’t last long in the outside world. The most bizarre part of this reality
     show is that in order to see each other in the flesh, the couple must get engaged and plan a wedding in
      a matter of weeks. But not all of them will make it down the aisle.`

    description: `Next in Fashion is a perfect binge for Project Runway fans, offering Netflix’s take on the
    tried-and-tested fashion competition format. Eighteen designers draw, cut and sew for the chance to win a
     cash prize and the opportunity to sell their line on Net-a-Porter, designing looks from red carpet
     dresses to sportswear under unrealistic time conditions (but minus the surprise ‘twists’ that made
      Project Runway so mean). Hosts Alexa Chung and Tan France keep the mood light, but the real draw is
      the sheer talent of the designers, most of whom are already very accomplished and manage to magic up
      some truly impressive catwalk showstoppers.`

    description: `The second season of this raunchy teen show is the biggest highlight on Netflix in 2020 so
    far. Although it has a distinctly American glow, with jocks, Acapella groups and mean girls, Sex Education
    is set in the UK and filmed in Wales. Asa Butterfield stars as an awkward teenager who starts giving sex
     counselling for money, and Gillian Anderson plays his mother in her typical graceful style. While the
     titular topic is used as a source of comedy, Sex Education also explores issues related to intimacy and
     identity issues in a smart way that will dredge up your emotions.`

    caption: 'The Witcher',
    description: `Netflix Original The Witcher is, by objective critical standards, not particularly good.
    But as binge-worthy escapist enjoyment, it’s an absolute triumph. Based on a Polish fantasy literature
    franchise that gained global popularity following its successful video game adaptation, the series follows
    Geralt of Rivia (played by Henry Cavill), whose occupation as a mutant ‘witcher’ sees him slaying
    monsters for money. Our beefy, gravel-voiced hero finds himself caught up in a bigger plot, however,
    as his destiny becomes entwined with an orphaned princess on the run and a powerful sorceress testing
    the limits of her abilities.
    With its restrained dialogue, monster violence and discombobulated timeline, the series sometimes feels
    more like a mashup of video game cutscenes than a cohesive dramatic narrative – but it works.
    The Witcher’s real success is in seeming to recognise that viewers don’t necessarily want their ridiculous
    fantasy shows to be too high-brow or pretentious, and are mainly here to see some cool magic effects and
     sexy Geralt in the bath (surprising exactly no one, there is plenty of gratuitous female nudity too).`

    description: `Nick Kroll's wacky, geeky, puerile cartoon about puberty is one of the funniest shows on
     Netflix right now. It's all very sick and very wrong but the writing is sharp, the plots get more and
      more surreal and the voice cast is killer: Kroll himself, Fred Armisen, Maya Rudolph as a Hormone
      Monster, Jason Mantzoukas, even David Thewlis as The Shame Wizard in season two.`

    caption: 'Happy',
    description: `Nick Sax is a detective turned hitman who revels in his completely dysfunctional life.
    Then, after suffering a heart attack during a hit, he wakes up to find he is now accompanied by Happy,
    a small blue flying unicorn. He’s the imaginary friend of his kidnapped daughter Hailey, and believes
    that Nick is the hero that will come to her rescue.
    What follows are a large amount of serious violence and disturbing scenes, which will likely be off-putting
    to some viewers. That said, the story, adapted from a short comic series with the same name, is an
    amusingly twisted version of serious crime dramas, with a dark sense of humour that stands up even when
    you’ve wiped all the blood away.
    Some of the jokes are based on the obvious contrast between Nick’s indifference to the horrors of the
    criminal world and Happy’s childish naivety, but that dynamic changes through the eight episodes of the
    series, before viewers can get tired of it.`

    description: `Netflix's first ever Original is a brilliant crime and fish-out-of-water black comedy that's
    worth trying if you never saw it first time around. Stevie Van Zandt, best known for his role as a mob
    boss in The Sopranos, plays an eerily familiar mobster who chooses to move to Norway when he turns
    state's witness. He ends up in Lillehammer, which he remembers from the 1994 Winter Olympics, and
    predictably begins building a mafia-style criminal empire, complete with seedy bar, in partnership
    with some of the less than scrupulous locals.`

    this quirky comedy when his character, Miles, decides to go for a spa treatment that will help him be
     a better person. With one radiant new Miles, and one cranky, tired Miles, navigating life becomes harder
      as they have to learn to put up with each other. Aisling Bea plays his wife Kate, who isn’t aware that
      she has two husbands under the same roof and just wants back the man she married.`

    caption: 'Pose',
    description: `It's 1980s New York, the height of the AIDS epidemic. Madonna's Vogue is playing everywhere,
     and the underground ballroom scene – haven to mostly black and Latino trans and gay people – is a
     dizzying, glitzy whirlwind of joy and judgement.
    Blanca (MJ Rodriguez) decides to take control of her life after receiving an HIV positive diagnosis, and
    takes in a ragtag bunch of misfits that call her "mother". Among them is Damon, a talented 17-year old
    with dreams of becoming a dancer and Angel, a young trans woman who would love to be a model (but works
    as a prostitute). Worlds collide when Damon gets into the prestigious New School for Dance and Angel
    falls in love with young executive Stan Bowes (Evan Peters) – who happens to work for Donald Trump.

    The world of Pose, inspired by the legendary 80s documentary Paris is Burning, hits a sweet spot: it
    tackles profoundly difficult issues like discrimination, sexism and poverty, between joyous dance and
    drag competitions. The series has no weak link. Billy Porter as ballroom MC Pray Tell, and Dominique
    Jackson as Elektra are truly magnetic, and ground what could have become too much of a tear-jerker with
     the perfect sprinkling of world-weary cynicism. If you missed it on BBC2, the perfect time to binge-watch it on Netflix is right now.`

     nowhere and proclaims himself the saviour of the world. Is he telling the truth or is he an extremist
      in disguise? This controversial ten-part drama, starring Michelle Monaghan as cynical CIA agent Eva
      Geller and an exceptional Mehdi Dehbi as wannabe prophet Al-Masih, will grip you from the get-go.
      We travel from Syria to the US as Al-Masih gains more devout followers and the CIA scrambles to
      determine, Homeland style, whether they should try to stop him.`

    description: `In an Ice Princess-meets-Skins series, a figure skater tries to get back into competition
    after a fall that left her with a head injury. Although the world of ice skating may look perfect and
    pristine, underneath there is a dark tension with mothers sniping abuse from the sidelines and young
    skaters risking permanent injury by continuing to skate on damaged hips. Kaya Scodelario stars as Kat
    who has to learn how to skate with a partner if she wants to get back on the ice, and January Jones
    plays her bipolar mother. There's even a cheeky cameo from Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness.`

    description: `Is The Next Generation the best Star Trek series? We're not getting into that debate, but
     you can decide for yourself by watching all seven series on Netflix. That said, brilliant though it is,
     you really shouldn't watch all seven seasons. The first is pretty turgid and the second is only
     marginally better, but TNG really hits its stride in season three and never looks back. Handily, the
     nature of Star Trek means you can safely miss dozens of episodes and miss nothing important, so a little
     strategic watching is in order. Wired.com's binge-watching guide will navigate you safely around the land
     mines, so you can enjoy the absolute sci-fi gems hidden within.`
